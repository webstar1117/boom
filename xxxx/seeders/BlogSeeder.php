To further help consumers stay in the loop on what’s going on at restaurants in their city, today, we’re launching an entirely new experience that better surfaces relevant, local and unique content from restaurants to a user’s home feed.</span></p><p><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span>For the first time ever, Lagoslocal iOS users will be able to scroll through a vertical feed that features visual content from local restaurants in their city, including&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.lagoslocal.com/2018/06/introducing-popular-dishes-on-lagoslocal-taking-the-guesswork-out-of-what-to-order" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 143); background-color: transparent;">Popular Dishes</a>, popular photos from consumers and updates directly from restaurants. The content shown on Lagoslocal’s home feed is contextualized to users based on various factors, including their proximity to the business, the recency of the content and the popularity of a dish in reviews.</p><p>When a user clicks on a Popular Dish on their home feed, they will be redirected to see more photos and reviews mentioning the dish from that restaurant. To identify Popular Dishes, Lagoslocal uses machine learning to look at the most commonly mentioned dishes within a restaurant’s reviews, and pairs them with photos and reviews of that dish. When a user clicks on a popular photo that isn’t a dish, such as the interior or exterior of the restaurant, they will see more details about the photo on the business page.&nbsp;</p><p>For restaurants that use&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.lagoslocal.com/2019/09/lagoslocal-connect-a-new-voice-for-restaurants-to-reach-locals" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 143); background-color: transparent;">Lagoslocal Connect</a>, a paid feature that enables businesses to share updates with new and existing customers, their posts will gain greater visibility than ever before as users will now easily discover these Connect posts right on their home feed. In fact, our initial testing showed that this new experience may help increase consumer engagement with businesses’ Connect posts by as much as 30%. When users click on a Connect post from their home feed, they will have the option to view the business’s Lagoslocal page or share the post with others. Users can also engage with this content by tapping the heart icon, letting the business know that their content is resonating with potential customers.</p><p><br></p>',

How much will this cost? But occasionally they wonder, “Who’s Emily?”&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of people come in and they go, ‘Oh, you really exist? I thought it was just the name,’” said the garage’s owner and namesake.</p><p>Emily is, in fact, Emiliana “Emily” Chavez—the former tech analyst and entrepreneur who is challenging a male-dominated industry with four, woman-owned auto repair shops across the Seattle area. The branding is intentional; Chavez has put herself forward as the face of the company, partly because she wanted to recreate the personal relationship people once had with their mechanics, but also to put other women at ease. Everything about the Emily’s Garage experience—from the logo to the service providers—lets her customers know: You’re welcome here.</p><p>Women hold just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-the-automotive-industry/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 143); background-color: transparent;">23% of jobs in the auto industry</a>&nbsp;(and Latinx women only 3%)—one of the various reasons&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2017/04/05/for-women-especially-it-pays-to-know-what-car-repairs-should-cost" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 131, 143); background-color: transparent;">women may feel uncomfortable</a>&nbsp;when seeking car repairs. And that was something Emily could deeply relate to. Despite her upbringing—the daughter of a mechanic, who grew up watching her dad fix his truck—she said her first visit to an auto shop alone was frustrating. “I was like, ‘I’m not an idiot,’” she said. “They didn’t even bother to understand who I was or my background. They just assumed I was a woman so I didn’t know.”</p><p>When she’d saved enough to start her own business in 2017, she vowed to overhaul this experience. Bringing in her expertise from the business and tech world, she has focused on creating a customer experience where women aren’t treated like they know nothing—and are even given the chance to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>I want to give women of color the strength to know that they can do it too.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>EMILY CHAVEZ</strong></blockquote><p>And there’s another reason she’s put herself front and center: As a Latinx woman, she wants to make a change, moving toward equity for women of color. “I felt like, as a minority-owned, woman-owned business, my flag needs to be raised,” Chavez said. “Because it’s still not common, and I want to give women of color the strength to know that they can do it too. I want people to know that about us and that there’s not an Emily’s Garage corporate overlord.”&nbsp;</p>',

We also remain flexible in how we’re approaching the physical return to our offices.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we live and work. Vaccination has proven to be the number one means of preventing the spread of and serious illness caused by the virus. As an additional health and safety measure, we will require U.S. employees who access our offices to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and we continue to offer paid time off for vaccination.&nbsp;</p><p>Our reopening plans, timelines and safety protocols are regularly assessed to reflect the latest information. Due to the latest information about the Delta variant, we postponed our Phoenix office reopening pilot to September 15, as well as pushed back the reopening of our other offices to later this year through early 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>We also continue to adjust our office space to best support our hybrid model, complete with amenities that foster a culture of collaboration and creativity for our distributed teams.

With this in mind, our San Francisco office will move to 350 Mission Street, where Lagoslocal will occupy three floors of the state-of-the-art high-rise building in SoMa. We plan to welcome back San Francisco employees who choose to access the office by early 2022.</p><p>Our teams will continue to work over the next few months to make sure our offices provide the ideal space for our hybrid model, maintaining an equitable and safe environment for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>We remain committed to continuing to build Lagoslocal into a great place to work for all our employees regardless of location.
